This project is to help blind people with a Smart Stick. Stick automatically alarms if the target is near, 
it will alert in such a way user is able to identiy that he is reaching near the target.

1. Arduino UNO
2. Ultrasonic Sensor 
3. Buzzer
4. Speaker?? = Planning to give some audion instruction to the user.

Stick will start alerting if the object is near 1.5 meters, and when the target is reaching near, it will be a stable bepp from the buzzer.

Note:- Arduino can only play 16 bit PCM 8kHZ audio mp3 & that mp3 should be coded using a encoder software
